It's like she lost a filter or something because usually she's polite but my wife suspected that our daughter's sudden misbehavior occurred after she started hanging out with new girls from the school. Basically the mean type and have picked on their behavior. I've sat with my daughter and had many discussions about how her behavior has been negatively affecting everyone around her. Our housemaid is the person most affected here and my daughter has chosen her to be her target for hair, clothes, \"etiquette\" criticism. She has complained about our daughter calling her offensive names like filthy and gross for cleaning certain areas in our house.

I had an confrontation with her immediately and she denied and cried saying she never touched the phone nor had any idea how it got there. I noticed my daughter calling her theif repeatedly so I told her to stop and go to her room. I checked the indoor camera before continuing the argument and saw my daughter place her iphone inside our housemaid's bag, I was livid. I apologized to the housemaid and gave her the rest of the day off. I then showed the video to my daughter and she was absolutely speechless. I said what she did was immoral and straight up offensive to tamper with that poor woman's livelihood over a petty party she couldn't go to. I told her she was grounded and will have to spend the night in the backyard (she is a germaphobe) but she cried begging me to not make her sleep with the dirt, insects and hot temp.

If I did I would want them hurt, I wish the exact opposite. Two, I have unblocked all the family and sent them a pretty long msg calmly explaining what had happened and what my concerns were. I also included a link to a child falling off a horse the size of mine, explaining I don't want any kid to face injury, disability,or death. The response has been very, very positive. Third, I have reached out to the family of the birthday girl and explained what happened. They were mortified as had no idea I hadn't given permission. I have set up a meet-the-horsey for this weekend, with the landowners permission. We're setting up an arena with temp fencing etc. She doesn't know it but there will also be two ponies from the hire place there for pony rides for her and her friends ;)\n",

I keep her in a huge field 24/7 with other horses and she is the absolute apple of my eye. I don't mind people saying hi to her over the fence, we live in the suburbs so obviously it's going to happen. What I HATE is how my mother keeps offering her friends grandkids pony rides. Neither my horse or I are kid uh...people. I'm sick of showing up at the property to be met with a gaggle of kids expecting a pony ride. I've laid down the law and told mum no more. She EXPLODED at me but I've stayed firm. I spoke to the property owner because I worry mum will just show up and try to give the kids a pony ride without my supervision. He agreed it's a liability and has marked her as not allowed on the property without me there. Yesterday he called me saying she was there with 12 KIDS. 12! And going off her rocker because he wouldn't allow her on the property. I spoke to her on his phone and told her to bugger off and NEVER try this rubbish again. Since then I've had to block her and most of my family because omg the flying monkeys and screaming about how I'm over privledged, selfish, and a child hating monster... I don't think I was wrong, but it's starting to really get to me. Was I the AH?\n",

            "\n",
            "After her first seizing episode, we went to a neurologist who diagnosed the febrile seizures. His directions for responding to a seizure were to strip our daughter down, put a cool cloth on her body, and wait for her temperature to drop. Then pump her full of Motrin to manage the fever. He said, while scary, the seizures were harmless and she would grow out of them. No long-term effects, no worry of anything beyond 5 minutes of shaking while her body cooled itself down. \n",
            "\n",
            "Since then, we’ve experienced about 6 seizures, 4 of which I was home for. I followed the neurologist’s directions and we got through the seizures like a breeze. In a matter of minutes, she was up and wanting to play again. My wife’s initial reaction, however, was to cuddle our daughter in the bed, which actually increased her body temp. In each case, I had to argue with my wife to let go of our daughter so I could cool her down. The cuddling was a result of my wife’s anxiety and her need to soothe herself by nurturing our sick daughter. I get that, but it was the opposite of what we needed to do in that moment. \n",
            "\n",
            "On the 2 occasions I wasn’t home for the seizures, my wife called 911 and an ambulance came. Both times, I rushed home to inform the 1st responders about her condition and instructed them on how to cool her down. Both times they recommended taking her to the ER, and both times we ended up paying $1000 for a 4-hour ER visit where they gave her nothing more than a dose of children’s Motrin. \n",
            "\n",
            "AITA for telling my wife that we need to follow our neurologist’s directions instead of calling 911 and racking up unnecessary medical bills? I showed her the most recent bill and she accused me of caring more about money than her mental health or our daughter’s health. I don’t think that’s the case at all. In her words, it’s worth $1000 for her (my wife) to be surrounded by medical professionals, and if I don’t agree, then I’m the bad guy. In my view, my wife needs to work with her therapist so she can better handle stress, and can follow our doctor’s directions when our daughter has a seizure while I’m not home.\n",

            "So, my night last night did not exactly go as planned...this is long, but so was my random journey last night! Here we go!  \n",
            "My friend \"Kay\" (20s F) and I (30s F) were supposed to hangout after she got off work. Just take her husky to a small hiking trail, grab some food and chill. She texts me about an hour before she was going to head over to let me know she couldn't make it because she got a turtle call. Kay is in vet school and works in a turtle hospital that takes in injured wild turtles. I said ok no problem, we can hang out later.   \n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "Now, this is where the FU starts. I figured since we weren't going hiking or probably doing anything that I would indulge in an edible, mow the lawn and settle into some gaming for the night. I had a small chunk left of some Silly Wonka, and if anyone is not familiar with that, its like Russian Roulette of THC content. Some bites are mild, others are like, dear god you are floating in space.   \n",
            "\n",
            "So, I pop the last bite in my mouth, put some headphones in to listen to music and go start mowing. I get about half way through the yard and it hits- plenty strong for a really good high, but not danger level/seeing god, so we are good. Let me tell you, the rest of the lawn mowing was pretty awesome. I think at one point I was half dancing to the tunes while mowing. This was also the time that Kay texted me again. Turns out the turtle wasn't being brought in so she was free and her and doggo where headed over for us to go hike.   \n",
            "\n",
            "I thought, ok, I'm fucked up, but like, I can handle a mild hike, so let's do it! I texted back \"Ya! But just FYI, I ate an edible so you have to drive and be the responsible adult\". We get to the trail and so far so good. I am baked af, and the forest seems so magical. At one point I was rambling on about living in the little ferns because they looked so beautiful... a beautiful Fern Gully. (I hate myself for accidentally making that joke in the moment too). Alright so hike goes well, and it's time for food. Since we have doggo, I suggest a place we love with outdoor patio and it's nearby. We get there and dear lord it is PACKED. I don't actually know why or how there were that many people there as even without COVID restrictions it was overloaded. Anyway, high me was like \"oh lemme go ask how long the wait is\". So I get out, go check with the hostess, and surprise, the wait is like 90min, so I was like, ya no. Alright, back to the car to regroup!  \n",
            "\n",
            "I get in and Kay goes, \"so how do you feel about detours?\" Now, I barely registered what she said, because the second wave of this edible is currently washing over me. So I am like- yea man detours are cool. (Da fuq? who says that? high me...that's who). Kay: \"Ok great, because that turtle is coming in after all, so uh, we gotta go get it, check it in and then we can go eat\". So now we are on our way to the turtle hospital to pick up this little guy/girl that was hit by a car. We were about 20min away and so was the lady dropping off turtle bro. When we get there, we see a family in their car staring at us and I think- yea that's prob them, but first we gotta go inside and get paperwork and such. So we head in, doggo in tow and get situated in the turtle lab. BTW, I am not a vet...or vet student, so not only have I never been to this turtle lab, I am not 100% sure I was supposed to be, but at this point, I am still high af and just down to go see some recovering turtles. Kay starts showing me some JUMBO snappers that are on the mend all while she is waiting for the lady with turtle bro to call and let her know she is there. At one point I asked if the lady in the parking lot was her, but she said she was supposed to call. 30 minutes go by...finally Kay calls the lady and yea...she's been sitting outside this whole time. Welp. So, Kay heads out to grab turtle bro, while I'm just waiting with doggo in the turtle lab. She walks with a large heavy looking bag, sets it on the bench and reaches in to pull him out  turtle bro and assess damage...  \n",
            "Now, Kay has told me that the injuries they see range on a scale of like 1-10. 1 being \"stunned\" and not really injured, 10 being \"nothing we can do\". As soon as she pulled turtle bro out of the bag it was pretty clear it was a 9.5 on the scale :(   \n",
            "I don't wanna go into too many details, but my heart broke for this little bro. She was honest and said there was probably not much anyone could do, but that she'd make turtle bro comfy for the night with pain meds and such for potential surgery in the morning. Turtle bro was in too rough of shape even for sedation at that point.   \n",
            "Kay starts to work on trying to put the large pieces of broken shell somewhat back together, which is where shit got real for me REAL fast.   \n",
            "\n",
            "Kay: \"Hey, I hate to ask, but can you help me for a second?\"  \n",
            "Ok, so, I'm not a vet, but I am a molecular biologist so I am no stranger to lab work, aseptic technique or animal work. I even worked in an animal hospital for a while as an undergrad. So, even though I was STILL high AF, I jumped up, grabbed some gloves and dove in, cause let's face it, turtle bro needed my help. The entire back half of turtle bro was broken into pieces, all the tissue etc exposed, so we had to do what we could to help. So there I am, probably just coming down from peak edible high, gloves on, holding giant pieces of shell together to cover turtle bros internal organs while Kay temp patched them together. We got turtle bro cleaned up and patched up as best we could, setup in a warm box with heating pad and then headed out with doggo for dinner. I am still waiting for an update, although I understand it doesn't look good.   \n",

            "So we've all had to deal with unwanted advances. Many of us at work. I've had to deal with quite a few, probably because I work in a field where I have to be friendly, so whenever I'm at work, I'm just always sunshine and rainbows unless there's a reason not to be, and a lot of men don't understand thay this ISN'T flirting.\n",

Im friendly with him, like everyone, but I barely see him or talk to him. He's computer illiterate, so I give him my cellphone # (which is clearly posted on his desk anyways) so we can video call and I can walk him through fixing his computer instead of walking all the way over to his post to do it for him.

The day was going extremely slow, and I was very bored, so I decided to work on my logo (for a cartoon blog I was starting). I eventually finished the and wanted to take a picture of it. Unfortunately, the lighting was terrible, so I hung it on the wall behind the front desk which had better lighting. I immediately took down the logo after taking a picture, finished my shift, and then left for work. The next morning, I came into work and there was a repairman there. I asked him if he needed help and he said, \"Yeah. I'm here to fix the wall. Some idiot temp from the temp agency hung up a picture of some shit and it tore off some of the paint.\" He then showed me the spot where the tape from the picture had ripped off the paint (I kid you not. The damage was the size of a fingerprint). The repairman continued to fix the wall while simultaneously talking shit about the \"idiot temp.\" When he left, he said, \"So, who are you anyway?\" I just said, \"I'm the idiot temp,\" with a straight face, and it was immediately awkward. When the manager came in, I apologized and told her it was a mistake. I also said I was prepared to pay for the expenses, thinking it’d be like $40-$50 or something. Turns out, the building had spent $5000 to make that wall, and it was painted with real gold paint. The manager then told me that you could still see the spot (which is kind of bullshit. you could see it if you really looked for it while standing at an incredibly specific angle). I apologized again and she told me to go back to work. I spent the rest of my shift in fear of having to pay $5000. When my shift ended, I went home, still without answers. That night, my temp agency called and told me their insurance would be covering the wall and that I shouldn’t come into work for the last two days of my assignment. I asked them how this would affect me at the temp agency, and they told me not to worry about it. However, I haven’t heard a word for them for two weeks now, so I’m starting to really worry.\n",

I didn't move in, all of my stuff was still in my dorm room and I spent the majority of the day on campus (at least from 8am - 7pm). Even though I couldn't really help out financially with my SO, since he had a job at the time, I helped where I could - buy lunch, coffee, help clean, and I had a monthly stipend I could spend in the university store and I'd use that to help him out with groceries.

He thinks the financial situation should \"balance out.\" He hasn't had steady work, he'll be a bartender for awhile, then get bored of that. Then he'll work in retail or food for a few months, and go back to bartending. He seems to have a new job every 6-7 months. He's able to find work easily because he's so charismatic, but he'll eventually get bored and will want to do something different. \n",

This has been going on for about 4 months now, or about $2000 in rent.

I also feel like his parent because he makes a mess of the apartment (leaving trash on the ground, not cleaning up his spills on the counter, leaving dirty dishes out) and I end up cleaning it up. I don't want to, I usually ask him to clean it up, but I've waited up to 7 days before I relent and can't stand the site of the mess he's made, and then clean it up myself. Example - he spilled a large amount of syrup on the kitchen counter, didn't clean it up, it sat there for about a week. Every day I asked him to clean it up, I even laid out a sponge and some cleaning spray by it. I got sick and tired of it, and cleaned it up myself. \n",

He'll agree to do it, when I come home from work it will still be there. I ask him to take it out the next day, I'll come home, still there. I'll ask yet again, he'll get angry and says he's going to do it. This keeps up until the garbage is fucking disgusting, it's leaking and smells bad. I have asthma and garbage fumes can sometimes make me wheeze, so I take out the garbage. There was one time where the garbage pile grew to about 3 bags, it smelled terrible, shit was leaking, it was probably hazard - he didn't take it out, even though he said he would every day, and I eventually had to take it out. I know this sub doesn't like enabling, but I don't think most subscribers take into consideration the horridness of liquids that eek out from a garbage bag.

We've been having weird weather in my region, so it's been going back and forth from cold to warm. He's turning the AC to low temperatures when it's warm, and turning the heat way up when it's cold. Like the AC will be on 64F and fucking freezing when I get home sometimes, or he'll crank the heat up to 74F and it will feel like an inferno in the apartment. He'll also just turn the shower on when he goes to poop because he likes how it feels, the warm steam. I'll ask him, repeatedly, to keep the thermostat at a reasonable temp to save money and to not waste water. He usually responds by saying that the water bill is never that high and he wants to be comfortable temperature wise (which is apparently either arctic or magma). \n",

I told him that we can go out, but only if we just stick to an appetizer or an entree under $12, and only have 1 or 2 of the beer special that night. He ended up complaining that it should be more romantic, we should have gone to a nicer place, that we shouldn't have to stick to such a low value venue. I said I was sorry, but I couldn't afford anything nice. He ends up getting an app, the most expensive entree, several top shelf LITs and a dessert. I just had an app and one beer. The check came and it was more than I could afford, I asked him to help out, he gave me about $20 and told me I had to get the rest. I used the little cash I had on me and my card to pay for it all. \n",

Oh, it also smells like cigarette smoke in there, and I'm an asthmatic so it's now hard for me to breathe in the bathroom. I've pointed out all the proof I've seen to him, and he has an excuse for it all - he was just emptying out the ashtray from the porch in this trashcan and some of it accidentally got in to the toilet or sink. He claims that the beads of tar I see on the walls are just from cheap paint, and that it's actually the steam from the shower that's making the walls start to yellow.

In summer of 1991, I found a summer job as a “casual carrier” for the USPS. They used to hire summer temps to cover for all the full-time carriers who mostly took their vacations in the summer. \n",

Carriers were both openly and secretly monitored and timed on tasks and we had the first computerized time system I ever saw. They would be secretly followed a few times per year to be sure they were working hard the entire time they were outside the post office. The post office building even had secret back hallways, passive sound monitoring, and hidden raised viewing areas where they could see the sorting floor unobserved – cameras and microphones were hella expensive back then so this was all done using tricky architecture and the eyes and ears of the postal inspectors.\n",

People walking a delivery route were expected to do it FAST and better routes went to faster carriers. Slow carriers got mercilessly hassled to be faster and were disciplined for slowness. Look at Newman on Seinfeld. “Going postal” due to overwork was not really a joke there, because people would flip out and murder their bosses. I hear it’s worse now with GPS.\n",

So, once a week I got confronted with the entire week’s worth of heavy mail for this a-hole’s route. I confronted him about it and he basically laughed and said there was nothing I could do about it. The other FT carriers didn’t like Dave much, but I was a temp and he was there permanently so I was encouraged to just suck it up. \n",

The postmaster’s exact words were, “Just deliver every piece of mail for the route as fast as you can and don’t worry about the time it takes or anything else. You’re making huge OT on this route.” They did talk to Dave and the most egregious stuff stopped, but I was still doing most of the hard work on this route. \n",

In my first week, some of the nicer people took me aside at the beginning of the summer and made it clear to me that I was not to move quickly when delivering FT carrier’s routes because it could make them look bad and cause trouble for them. As a temp, I should always take longer than the FT carriers because (1) my job was limited and the USPS did not really track temps closely; (2) I had zero experience so everything should take me longer; (3) this was a union shop and they would hate to have to kick my butt for messing up their jobs; and (4) most of these people were awesome and I wanted to be a team player. So, I was incentivized to move slowly and not make the FT people look bad. Side note – I am very pro-union and pro-labor so this is not intended to knock unions, but the context is needed.\n",

            "After doing Dave’s route 1 to 3 times per week (he called in sick a lot, too) for a few weeks I knew if very well and was staying on top of the heavy stuff. Once I was comfortable with the route, I started RUNNING it. I would literally load up 3 mail bags for each segment of the route and jog or run his entire route. Dave’s route took him about 4.5 hours per day to walk. This was probably accurate for him and he’d been on the route for several years. I would finish it in 3 hours or less. Every day. Rain or shine.

I would come back, pick up other work and get that done. The fun started when Dave took a 2-week vacation and I handled his route 6 days per week. Since I was doing the work right, there was never a backlog of heavy items landing on me once per week. This made it even easier to jog or run his route as I was back to using one mailbag and fast-walking/jogging was enough to get it done quickly. I frequently got it done in under three hours and never took longer than about 3.5 hours. My personal best was under 2.5 hours.\n",

I would punch into his route on departure, keep the appropriate logs, and punch back in when I got back. The Postmaster then asked me about Dave’s route. I played completely dumb. He noted that I complained about the mail volume several weeks ago and that I used to take 6, 7, or more hours to get it delivered. I explained that I was spreading the heavy deliveries out over the whole week and that had really made a difference. He asked me if I was really delivering all the mail and whether I was hiding or throwing away mail – a serious problem if true. I got very offended and told him I delivered every piece of mail for the route, every day. \n",

I told him lots of people on the route seemed surprised that I did not want a soda pop or to sit down and talk for a minute like Dave always did with them (pure lies). All in my innocent, gosh-I-want-to-help-the-USPS voice. I told the postmaster that I was delivering all the mail as fast as I could and not worrying about anything else.\n",

He made a point of finding me on his first day back to ask how I enjoyed doing all the hard work for him while he was vacationing. I told him I’d learned a lesson about how to treat your coworkers. He laughed at me and went back to sorting mail. He came back a few minutes later and said he got me a souvenir, he then pulled his middle finger out of his pocket. Classic Dave.\n",

            "That was my last week at the USPS and I headed back to college. I kept in touch with some of the friends I’d made there and one of them was very happy to tell me that Dave was fired about two months after I left. Due to the massive discrepancy in how long it took me and him to deliver the route, the higher-ups audited his route and discovered that he actually was lollygagging, taking unauthorized breaks, and apparently having an affair with a woman on his route – all on the clock. I, on the other hand, was in great physical shape after all that running and had pockets full of cash for that semester. His regular T6 also got most of the heavy stuff dumped on her, so she didn’t get into any trouble for her delivery times because she was swamped with heavy mail on her day.

Then he barely bothered to go at all. Worse still, he never helped around the house. Never washed up, cleaned up, did laundry – nothing. He was even fired from his job for too many no-shows.

After disappointing my parents in high school with dismal academic scores and a serious predilection for teenage rebellion, I ended up in a small-town college with a close-knit Christian community, pursuing a degree in media studies. It wasn't the best place I could be, but it was fair compromise between my father's demand that I learn a paying skill and my own yearnings for liberation. Very quickly into this graduation program, I realized it was a waste and college was going to be a massive bore. So I spent most of my time courting (gullible) women or smoking pot.

            "This is when two new characters entered my life. First was a new male professor, an external faculty, a scrawny slimy fellow (SSF henceforth). He taught a major paper and was very well connected with the local Church which had a lot of say in the college administration. On Sundays, he moonlighted as pastor for a small branch of the big church. SSF also had a reputation for acting fresh with boys. I laughed about it with my friends, until one day SSF made a pass at me. And not a verbal one. I pushed him off me, told him I am not gay, reminded him he is a teacher and asked him to get his act together. Now, I am not a homophobic. But at that point, young and freshly-assaulted as I was, I remember using profanities that would count as homophobic or hurtful.

            "The second entry was a new lecturer, a garrulous young woman. Let's call her Rose. She was fresh out of University, had worked a few odd jobs, and had landed this lecturing gig through some connection in the Church. She was from town, had studied in this college and knew the dean of the department well.  Rose and I got off on the wrong foot to start with - a debate on art going off hand, as I found her imagining Christian motifs and theology in Picasso. She put me down, I didn't mind. I wasn't too interested either. But just to spite her, I kept turning up essays rebutting her points and she kept marking me with really harshly, supplementing the dismal marks with juicy opinions on what she thought of my intellect. It became a game between us. \n",
            "\n",
            "Now I would like to imagine Rose had a roving eye, as she seemed to favor the young, good looking boys and really put down the girls in class. Except one. Jess had been a classmate of ours and she was a local. So, she did not shack on campus and had kept a low profile. She did not shine, but she wasn't disliked either. Suddenly, after Rose's joining college, Jess started to shine in academics. Happens often when the teacher is right for the student.  Rose marked her extremely highly for a few assignments and this got a lot of nerds in class really jittery, who saw a new challenger in Jess for the crown of nerd king/queen.  Some of them even read the assignments that Jess has turned in and found them highly incoherent. Nothing explained the grades she was getting. This did not bother me, as grades and nerd-drama was never my thing. \n",
            "\n",
            "But then, by a stroke of misfortune, one of our other professors, who taught us two other papers, met with an accident and was off action for almost two months. A temp was hard to find and since most of her teaching workload in those two months was going to be practical oriented, Rose very gallantly volunteered to fill in for her. Which, it still fathoms me, she was allowed to. What it meant was that Rose was now grading our assignments and papers for three subjects and suddenly Jess' fortunes really turned. From being a challenger to the crown, she became the nerd queen, with her cumulative grades putting her on top of the pile. Jess just smiled through it all and made it out to be her hardwork finally getting recognized. A small coterie started to gather around her. It still didn't bother me. My universe was still in balance.\n",
            "\n",
            "Then one day, one of our batchmates saw Rose and Jess hanging out after college. They were shopping in some mall. Said batchmate decided to lurk around and find out what was cooking. Imagine his surprise when he saw them walk out of the mall and take the taxi together. Imagine his greater surprise, when he followed them to find out enter the same household. Picture the pure shock for the entire batch, when a day later we were all told that Jess and Rose are sisters. Fucking blood sisters. Born of the same parents. All of them still living under the same roof. Somehow both sisters had conveniently forgotten to bring it up around others when they were in college. They had pulled this subterfuge for about 4-5 months now.\n",

            "A bunch of nerds ganged up and approached the dean for our courses and brought her upto date to this scenario. Turns out dean knew all along about them being siblings and had actually encouraged Rose and Jess not to talk about it, so as not to fan talks of conflicts of interest. And now she refused to believe that Rose was being partial to her sister. I think she didn't want to go the trouble of replacing Rose.  The nerds were heartbroken. But I was still laughing. In Rose and Jess, I saw a kind of petty evilness, that I could appreciate.\n",
            "\n",
            "Then, for one of the papers that Rose was covering, we were assigned a practical project that required teamwork. I was put in the group with a girl I fancied and to impress her, for once I threw my minimum-effort policy out of the window. We worked on it together and our young adult rom-com had just begun taking shape. By the time we submitted the project together, this girl and I were very much into each other.  Then Rose walked in and took a shit on the project. She made it part of our game and added those choicest expletives in her remarks for both of us, that she had so far reserved only for me. Needless to say, Jess got top marks with a shitty effort. It broke my girl's heart. She sobbed on my shoulder, my gallantry came into question, and I was finally ready to settle some scores with Rose. But nothing major. Just a little sticking it to the man.\n",

            "As I have mentioned, this story is from 13 years ago. About then, the world was waking up to social media and our college was not too far behind. In fact our department had quite a chattery group on one such social media site (that does not exist anymore, but used to be named after a Middle-eastern Google engineer]. Rose and Jess were not in the group, but some of the faculty were. I started writing and posting long satirical sketches of Rose, that ridiculed her teaching abilities and poked at her extra-love for baby sister. I was hoping to get some of the faculty to take notice, but mostly I just wanted to be a dick to the sisterhood. A few days in, the posts generated a lot of laughs amongst the students on the group but the faculty stayed away. Not be discouraged, I wrote my worst stinker of a skit caricaturing Rose. Reddit I will be honest - I wasn’t kind an didn’t mince my words. It was a nasty piece of work, meant to hurt. I wrote it, posted it gloated with a few buddies who commented and forgot all about it. Here, I need to pause in my narrative -\n",

            "- And tell you folks about another stroke of misfortune that befell me at this point. One fine lazy afternoon, between classes, I had rolled myself a little doobie and smoked that thing in the college loo. As I stepped out, after washing my eyes – I found the familiar face of SSF grinning at me. With all the mischief and slime he could muster. The air around us reeked of weed and SSF’s grin grew broader. He told me what my options were. He could A] tell my parents; B] tell the college; C] tell the cops. OR. D] I could suck his dick and he would forget about it all together. I thought he must be joking, but SSF held that stupid grin and slunk out of the loo, stoned and slightly scared, TBH.\n",
            "\n",
            "I had no intentions of getting anally-raped by SSF for smoking pot. But I had no time to worry about that as I started getting frantic calls from batchmates. Rose and Jess had found out about the group and my posts. Jess has made a few crying calls to people. And Rose was livid. The group's moderator - one of the our batchmates - panicked and deleted the entire thread. I was summoned by the dean for an emergency meeting.\n",
            "\n",
            "When I arrived in her room, Rose and Jess were already there, sobbing bucket loads, calling me names, and holding up printouts of my posts. I had come prepared for this and proceeded to decimate their complaint with a well-constructed and elaborate speech on how Rose's nepotism is severely bad for the institution and student morale, and that I was only questioning her actions. Satire was just my tool to do so. Well you see, my well thought out arguments didn't appeal to the dean. She didn't even know what nepotism meant and I had to explain the word to her (I am not making this up. This dean is now a local councilwoman). She told me that I had slandered Rose's good name and brought disrepute to the college with my actions. They would have to throw me out. This I was not expecting. I had thought my speech would do the trick. I panicked. After all the effort dawdling through this course, I needed the degree. Then gathering my wits, I told the dean that my opinions weren't just mine alone. The nerds had brought it to her attention as well. The dean tried to play it down, saying the nerd issue had been dealt with, but I called BS on that. I demanded she involve my entire class to see whether they would back me up on this. Rose said they won't. Jess was sure too. The dean agreed, thinking this will sort the mess simply. No class would gang up against faculty. Like all bad managers, she did not realize that her stop-gap quick fix solution would open a can of worms.\n",
            "\n",
            "I was playing a gamble. I had no idea what my class would say. Sure, some of them had laughed and commented on the posts, but would they really stand up for me. I had no idea I was even that liked. But I guess the class had enough of Rose. Or they just liked my satire. Bottom line is, when Dean assembled the class and called a vote on the matter, our entire class (apart from Jess) agreed that Rose was unfair and nepotistic. They backed me up. I had never been particularly attached to my class (except the girl). But now I could kiss each of them. The dean had to agree that maybe, just maybe, Rose was unfit for the job. A departmental enquiry had to be instituted, so that these charges could be heard. I wasn't going to be thrown out after all.\n",
            "\n",
            "Rose was not happy and I think she went to Church with it. For soon I found myself in front of the President of the college, along with Rose and the dean. Rose painted it to seem like I had turned the class against her and I had inflicted psychological damage on Jess. The president consulted the dean, heard all that had happened and decided to let the enquiry make up its own mind. At this point I began to suspect the department enquiry was going to be heavily stacked against me.\n",
            "\n",
            "As an added bonus, the president decided that the college needed an internet communication policy - a protocol on what students and teachers can say or discuss about the college and it's functioning over social media and the internet. It was to include rules on how students and teachers interacted over the internet and recommend punishment for misdemeanors. [This was still the nascent stages of social media folks. Colleges didn't know what to do back then].\n",
            "\n",
            "Most of the college did not know about this Internet Code being formulated. I did, because the dean and Rose had both taken out time from their busy teaching schedules to inform me that as soon as this Internet Code had been formulated, I would be chucked out for my actions. My days in college were numbered. My girl cried more on my shoulder. I felt like a tragic hero, a champion of the people, who will take the fall for his brethren. My class mourned me.\n",
            "\n",
            "In this state of mind, I returned to my dorm to find an email from SSF. He wanted to know what I had decided about his offer. In all this Rose social media fiasco, this shit had completely slipped my mind. I wanted to write back telling SSF to fuck off. Now that I was getting chucked out, his threats didn't matter. But then something struck me. I started exchanging emails with SSF and realized he had no idea about the Rose thing or the impending Internet Code [he was an external faculty]. This was God-sent. You see where all this is going now.\n",
            "\n",
            "Well suffice to say, that over the next couple of days, over a series of emails with SSF, I discussed my apprehensions about the offer and my hesitations as I was not gay. I played the scared victim here, and let him coax me into 'giving in' to his demand. Honestly, I was just baiting him. And waiting for the president's Code to roll out.\n",
            "\n",
            "Sure enough, a couple of weeks later, our college unveiled it Internet Policy - banning social media for both students and teachers alike, and the usual set of guidelines to follow while interacting on the internet. By now I had gathered enough dirt on SSF. So, when the president summouned me for a disciplinary hearing under the new internet code, I sat down and wrote the speech I was going to give to the president. My girl was in on this and she helped me with it.  Once I was confident about what to say, I printed out the email exchange, neatly bounded it all together into one file and headed to the president a little before the appointed hour. I met him and showed him the entire email exchange. I wanted to know how SSF's emails to me scored on this Internet codebook. Would it look good if I had to drag the professor, a pastor at that, and the college to court for sexual harassment? What would a good Christian town say about that?  That did the trick.\n",
            "\n",
            "His tone changed, he saw my angle in all of this and promised action. I also told the president that the dean sucked at her job which is why creep like SSF and nepotistic shits like Rose ran riot. Now I didn't want any of them - Rose, the dean or SSF - to be able to screw my career. The president assured me that they won’t be left capable to do that, but I had to keep my mouth shut about those emails. I took the deal. A week later, I signed a non-disclosure with the college, handed them all the printouts and deleted my emails under their lawyer's supervision.\n",
            "\n",
            "SSF's contract with the college was terminated and he was expelled from his church. No one knew why.

I understand the Switch was a rushed console, but there is no excuse at this point for the console to be so bare bones and featureless and for Horizon to feature such a terrible UI.

            "UPDATE 5 (4/4/17): So i finally received the new laptop on friday 3/31. But i still had to play some games with customer service though even after all this. They kept me updated every few days on my new order which was great, but then went MIA right before the date they told me it would show up which was the 28th. Last i heard from them was on the 24th and it took me 3 more phone calls and 2 more emails on the 27th and 28th to finally find out why it hasnt shipped. Then when they shipped it 3 days late, they couldnt even upgrade me to 1 day shipping like they said they would. But atleast the thing is finally in my hands. So far the new model has been 10x better than the old model, and actually works the way it is supposed to. CPU/GPU temps seems to be in line, screen isnt falling off, and the 7820hk is actually reaching the speeds they promised. I do have one small issue with the shitty toshiba SSD they put in there which is running hot tho. I requested a replacement and they told me they would send someone to my house and swap it out with a samsung SSD instead. So hopefully that doesnt take 93 days. All in all, i still stand by what i said with my last update that there customer service is pretty shitty. If you plan on buying an alienware laptop, be ready to be on the phone constantly making sure they dont forget about you. For example i called yesterday morning to request the SSD replacement, and they told me someone would call me back later in the day to set up an appointment. No one called and its now 28 hours since i called and im getting ready to get on the phone again to call them. If i didnt im pretty sure i would never hear from them again. \n",

It was a 20 year old Lexus that was in pretty good shape. And he rubbed it in my face for the rest of the time he was in senior year of high school. Compared with my brother I get just as good of grades as he does. Better in some cases even. I worked my hardest in the hope of fairness. I even did some volunteering cleaning up garbage in my local area. Then my 18th birthday came and went a few weeks ago. And the only thing I wanted, the only thing I was hoping for was a car. I wasn't expecting something like a new car, or a sporty car. Just something reliable like my brother got. The party wasn't anything like my brother's 18th. For his 18th my mom baked the cake herself. It was a delicious layered chocolate pudding cake. I got a sheet cake from the super market. For his they got a DJ. For mine it was my dad's old boombox with a couple of mix CDs. We went through whole party, and I figured my parents might have just been waiting to spring a surprise gift on me.

She ended up lecturing my parents that she was very very very disappointed in them for showing favoritism. Then she proceeded to announce to everyone still there that my parents thought it fine to get their first born son a car and DJ, but not their second. And then she even pointed out how much harder my parents tried for my brother's 18th birthday than they had for mine. My uncle was the first to stand up and say something.

The next few weeks went by with the silent treatment between us. But then a few days ago, my parents suddenly surprised me with a white 98 Subaru Legacy that runs great. They practically threw the keys and the title in an envelope at me and said to have fun. I got the car. And they're paying for insurance for the next six months like they did for my brother.

            "Since I couldn't update in r/AITA, I came here to do it. This is my original post Link I've not logged onto this account in roughly five months. So now I can tell you all the rest of what happened before college starts. But before that, there's some things I wanna get out of the way from previous commenters and messagers. I literally needed a car because there was no way for me to get a job without one. I had no personal transportation, and live over ten miles from the nearest bus stop. So for those who kept telling me to give the car back because they think I was either too spoiled and to accept life is unfair, or that I shouldn't take handouts, or I shouldn't except gifts from crappy parents, etc. Please just stop. My inbox was so crammed full when I logged back on that it took some time to go through it all. It doesn't really matter anyway though. I did get a part time job that later went full time for the summer after I graduated. But three weeks into working part time, the Subaru blew the head gasket while on the highway at like 45 miles an hour. The temp gauge redlined and I had to pull over and call for help. My grandparents took a look at the car and found that someone had ran a lot of gasket sealer in it, and it was still in the coolant. The car was basically bandaided back together before my parents bought it, and was then barely hanging on by a thread. It drove great, and I was never pushing the car hard as I'm kinda a slow driver. My parents claimed no prior knowledge of the problem. But their only real reaction was to shrug and say it was karma for making them get me the car in the first place. Well that was a mistake because my grandparents were right there to witness that, and they tore into my parents like none other. My grandma told me to go wait in my room and let them sort this out.\n",
            "\n",
            "It was two hours before I was called back into the living room. My parents were on the couch and both looked like they'd both been metaphorically hit by a truck. My uncle and two other relatives were there now too. My grandparents had gotten it out of them that when they bought the car, they just looked for the cheapest thing they could find close in the area that still ran, and bought it no questions asked. They didn't even bother to inspect the car, let alone properly read the ad for it. My uncle who knows a thing or two about cars told me that the engine would basically need to be rebuilt because the head gasket warped the block, and it'd cost more than the car is worth to fix it. I had to call into work and tell them I was unable to make it in because my car was dead. They understood and basically put me on a sort of unpaid leave for the moment. Now I want to point out that what happens next I had no involvement with. My grandparents just told me to chill for a while and let them and my parents take care of this. And they did. A few days later they came back with a 1999 Honda Civic Hatchback with 180.000 miles on it. It was white like my Subaru was, and drives great. It's not all wheel drive like the Subaru was. But it's great on the road and gets better gas mileage. There was also a list of all recent repairs done to the car. Things like a new radiator and stuff. My uncle also went over the car before giving it the ok. I thanked everyone profusely. My parents though had all the elation of Ben Stein on valium. They said very little and just walked away. There wasn't even that vibe they had last time of acting like they were giving a new toy to a brat. If I could put it to words, the way they acted was just pure defeat. The Subaru got resold later for $400 since that was the best we could get for it with the blown head gasket. And that money was put into my savings.\n",
            "\n",
            "That's only one half of what happened though. You see, when I said I did better in school than my brother, I wasn't kidding. My brother got a 30% scholarship after he finished high school. Well I got a 50% one. Not at the same college of course. But at one comparably good that was also closer. To say my parents were shocked is an understatement. Of course they just both looked unhappy as soon as the shock wore off. I decided it wouldn't be a good idea to poke the bear by asking them about it. But my grandma thought otherwise and poked that bear. And I mean REALLY poked it! First she asked if my parents were happy for me. And they claimed they were. But really didn't show in their attitudes. So my grandparents finally asked what their problem was. Why do they dislike me? Their second son was doing great, and even went above expectations. And they can't be happy about it? Did they want me to fail? Were they hoping I'd fail. What is the deal? My mother looked really upset, and my father couldn't look me in the eyes. They both meekly said they were happy for me. And managed to say they want me to take the world by storm when I go to college. And even said they'll help pay some of my tuition as well, just like they are for my brother. My grandparents both sharply said that they better keep their word, because there should never have been any favoritism, period. I thanked my parents for their help. Got a light if not limp handshake from my father, and a very stiff hug from my mother. It all felt so forced. I was and still am extremely thankful for the car and the tuition. But my parents just drained the room of all emotion.\n",
            "\n",
            "I ended up asking if my grandparents knew what it was that made my parents act this way. I asked if I was an accidental pregnancy or something. And they gave me the \"Its time we told you\" look. Well I'm not adopted like so many asked, but I was unplanned. Sort of.... You see, my parents wanted both a girl and a boy. But got two boys instead. My brother came out as a boy, so my parents were really hoping to get a girl on the next go. And they had a prior agreement to stop after two kids. They never got a girl. My grandma told me they refused to find out my gender till after I was born. They were convinced I'd be born female. And they'd bought a lot of baby stuff for a girl. And they didn't get a girl. My grandma said I ended up using all of my brother's hand-me-downs till I was three years old because my parents had bought so much girl stuff in advance that they couldn't use. So I was just a disappointment to them from the time I was born. My grandparents said that they know my parents are screwed up. But they've been the way they are for so long now that there's no point in expecting them to change.\n",
            "\n",
            "Since then my parents hadn't spoken to me much about college. In fact they ignore the subject as much as they can. And thanks to some of the warnings I got from people who messaged me making me paranoid, I called the college I've been accepted to and made sure to tell them that if anyone calls or emails pretending to be me, or my parents call trying to say I'm not coming, then to call me for a double or even triple check if anything like that happens. I mean, I kind of doubt my parents would do that sort of thing. Especially after everything that's happened. But I felt like playing it safe was the better option. Though there was something that I really didn't expect to happen. And that was my brother calling me. He called me out of the blue to talk. He said our grandparents called and told him everything. He told me he was sorry for what happened in his own way. And he hopes that once I'm on my own, I won't need to ever come back. He actually admitted to me that when he finishes college, he's going to stay in the state he's in because he likes it there. Our parents I do know actually really want him to come back when he gets his degree. But it looks like that's not happening. I said I don't blame him, and I may do the same. The rest of the conversation was a bit awkward because we aren't really used to speaking to each other much anymore.\n",

            "My grandparents and the rest of the family held a surprise party for me over the weekend. And they made it almost like a repeat of my brother's 18th birthday. There was a DJ, and a big chocolate cake my grandma made. I couldn't thank them all enough. My parents attended the party. But they were like wallflowers the entire time. They didn't say or do much. Just stayed sitting at a far table in the corner and drank beer quietly. The look of defeat they had was even greater now. I think the party wasn't just to congratulate me, but to also rub in my parents' faces that they should have done better. Because the rest of the family have made their disappointment in them clear. They seemed like they wanted to leave the party for a while. Can't say I blame them. They were being humiliated into staying where they were. My grandma said that you're never too old to be taught a lesson in humility.\n",

I made minimum wage, but a job is a job. And I wanna leave it with my best effort put in before my two weeks notice are up. I doubt I'm gonna be coming back here to make another update. And after my first post I'm just so tired of all the negative comments. About 95% of the comments on my original post were positive. And I wanna thank all of those who had nice things to say. You people rock. But the negative comments were so bad that I found it to be mentally draining. Some of the people who commented such negativity honestly feel like they've got worse issues than me. Lots of projecting maybe. If anyone had something harsh but constructive to say, that was fine. But some people just raged at me like they were foaming at the mouth.

What she didn't know is that from about a week after she started I knew she was sending daily complaints (all unfounded and untrue) to my manager about me. My manager and I get on socially and professionally and he was dumbfounded by her doing this. I still have no idea, why she did it to me either and until today I’d put her out of my mind.  \n",

I hug her a little bit longer when we see each other and say goodbye. I get excited when I see she’s messaged me, I have even dreamed about her. \n",

            "A couple of weeks ago it was my birthday. It fell on a Monday, so not a very exciting day granted. I’d already arranged with my parents to see them the following weekend for belated presents/cards. My husband was extremely busy Monday, he had said he had a big meeting on. Anyway, I didn’t get an acknowledgement, a card, a text. I went to work J had already arrived handed me a giftbag and card inside were some of my favourite chocolates from a handmade place down the road which is well known I love (also not cheap), and a few other very thoughtful and personalised little things that only someone who knows me would think to get. She even took me for lunch and got me a little cake from my favourite bakery. I didn’t tell her about my husband but when she asked what were our (his and my) plans for the evening, I didn’t know what to tell her. I made an excuse and moved on. \n",
            "\n",
            "When I drove home that night, a little part of me had worked up expectation that perhaps he had arranged something special for when I got home. Maybe even a surprise party! I had even stupidly convinced myself this was the case, so much so I was really excited. When I walked through the door, nothing. Not a damn thing. He was slobbed in front of the tv drinking a beer. He even had the audacity to say, “You’re a bit late aren’t you what are we having for tea?” translating to – what are you going to make! I told him, “Forget it, I’m going out”, he turned to look at me and was so pissed saying he’d had the worst day at work and was starving. I didn’t say a thing. Just got in my car and drove off. I drove straight to J’s. Needless to say, she was very surprised when I rocked up but welcomed me with open arms. We cracked open a bottle of wine and she ordered a takeaway and she got a few giggles out of me once I had calmed down. She didn’t bad mouth my husband once. Just listened. \n",

The more I think about it the more I realise how neglectful he has been of me. How I do everything in my power to please him. Make HIM feel special, sacrifices I’ve made to make him happy and valued, and I have had nothing in return for literal years. In the space of a few months J has made me feel more special and wanted than he has in the last 5 years and without even trying, I think. And if I am being honest, yes I do have a crush on her. She really does give me butterflies and giddy buzz I have never ever felt in my life. I find I am thinking about her, missing her when I’m not with her. I feel crazy for feeling this way but I have never felt like this about anyone ever. \n",

I stayed with the place for three years, but it has gone down as one of the worst jobs I ever had for many reasons. Bitchy nursing staff, insane hours, overworking me and coworkers, and just overall a very toxic work environment. I went in as a socially awkward girl with no spine for conflict or standing up for myself, and came out a much stronger person because of this place, but there is a particular series of events that led to that.\n",

My job I was hired for was to collect dirty trays and dishes from carts on their respective floors, wash all of the dishes that came into my dish room, and put them into the dish machine to be sanitized, before I let the dishes dry and store them where they needed to go. Then, at the end of the night, I would break down the machine and clean the filters of leftover food, and drain the water tanks of dirty soap water before going home. Over time, I became well acquainted with the dish machines we had, (*first one was 20+ years old and finally died on us. R.I.P. Big Bertha*) and I could troubleshoot a problem with it since I like machines enough to learn as much as I can about them. My boss took notice of this, and how hard I worked in the dish room every day. So he began to have me learn about the other parts of the department so I could fill in whenever someone called in: Cooking on the grill and serving food in the cafeteria, cashiering, helping to prepare food trays for patients, learning about different diets and their orders from the doctors, restocking floors for patient snacks and drinks, and finally deliver food to patient rooms. If that seems like a lot for one person, it was. Due to staff cutbacks, we were short a lot of manpower, so a couple of us had to learn as much as possible to keep us afloat.\n",

That, and pure stubbornness I guess. In that time, my boss hired a new Supervisor for our department, who will now be called Chad. At first, Chad seemed like a pretty nice guy. And me, being the awkward dork I am, tried to help him fit in with the others at work. I told jokes to him, got him to open up a bit to the others, and soon he was able to have a conversation rather easily. All was good! Then he passed his 3 month probation period, and was no longer being constantly watched by Boss.\n",

            "Chad turned into an insufferable asshole. He began to bark orders as if he owned the kitchen, demanding to know why certain things weren't being done *HIS* way, and overall was slowing down production tremendously for everyone. Not to mention, he himself was a lazy cunt. When there would normally be 2 people washing dishes, if one of them called in, it would mean whoever was there had to pick up the slack and do it all by themselves. Chad wouldn't lift a finger to help, unless he knew Boss was going to be in the kitchen and not in his office by HR. And even then, Chad didn't know what he was doing. And to top it all off, he made it a point to take jabs at ME in front of the others, trying to make me look stupid because I was the youngest member of the department.\n",

So when the topic of, \"What are you gonna do on your days off?\" came up, I usually said something like, \"I'm gonna relax at home and play (insert game) after doing some chores.\" Then Chad would make a remark like, \"Wow, you play video games? You must not have a life.\" Asshole.\n",

I began to make cracks back at him, and get into yelling matches with him in the kitchen (no sound escaped the doors once they were closed, so no one outside the department heard us.) He couldn't fire me, only tell my boss and sign a write up, which he never did because he saw it as a way of losing to me in our arguments. Any time he made jokes at me, I threw them right back, and when I knew he was doing something wrong, I would fight back and tell him how it was supposed to be done.

All the temperatures and times were recorded on a sheet and placed in a folder in the Dietitians office by the dish room. I was making my usual rounds of taking temps, when I noticed the machine was reading about twenty degrees in the red cooler than where it was supposed to be. I shut down the machine, and began to drain the water tanks. This was my way of troubleshooting if the tanks had just not been drained in a while, or if something was seriously wrong with the machine.

I continue to work on the machine, and once the tanks refilled, I initialed all of my temps and times on the sheet before returning it back in the office. The day goes by, and after a hellish time on the floors serving patients, I was in the middle of my cleaning duties with the Cook and Dean. I get called by Chad, saying that Boss wanted to talk to us. So, after making sure the dish machine was cleaned, I walked with him to Boss' office. There, Boss begins to tell me that Chad had given him evidence that I was slacking on my duties, and that I was not taking temperatures like I was supposed to for the Dish Machine. He said that thankfully, Chad took the temps, but if I wanted to keep from getting into trouble and to keep the department from getting into LEGAL trouble, I needed to step up and be a \"team player.\" He said that I was getting a verbal warning, but if I did this again, I would receive a write up or possible suspension.

He then traced over the pre-existing handwriting to make it look legit, with his initials!! He made it look like I had not taken temps all day during my shift. I wracked my brain wondering how the hell he could have gotten away with it with no one noticing him, and then it hit me.

            "Now since we are a hospital in a small town, it was normal for us to get Catering orders for the members of HR andUpper Management for when they had meetings upstairs. Those orders were easy, because usually they wanted chips, pre-made sandwiches, and soda for about 10-15 people. However, we occasionally got HUGE Catering orders for district meetings, and that was when we would bust out the Catering dishes. Large white immaculate plates, silverware, glass cups, punch bowl, food serving plates, desserts, tea, and cloth napkins were usually used for these events, and even though it was A LOT more dishes for the understaffed Aide's, it was pretty simple. This particular order was for the CEO, his workers, HR, Doctors, Head Nurses, and the Higher ups who owned the Hospital's contract. The estimated amount to be served was about 150 people, since many members of the board were going to show up as well. Usually we got the huge orders a week in advance, so the Supervisor can arrange the schedule to have more bodies on deck to help. Chad of course, schedules only me to be the afternoon dishwasher, meaning I had to clean the dishes for the ENTIRE hospital, and the catering order.\n",

It wouldn't have been so bad, if we didn't have to take apart the trays one by one to make sure no needles or blood were on the trays, and clean each piece. I was stressed beyond belief, because I knew that the 150 people Catering Order would be due any time now. But, I kept myself calm and tried to keep doing my job. A few hours go by, and Chad calls out to me to shut off the dish machine (it was very loud), and tells me to go and pick up the Catering order. Instead of arguing with him, I decided to do it, and asked if he was going to help me. He gives me a shit eating grin, and tells me,\n",

While i'm about to clean up the food serving table, I look over to see the door that led into the HR office  was open slightly, and a few women were laughing and commenting on how good the Pork Roast was at the meeting.

I also found out something that was just icing on my beautiful revenge cake. I found out from Dean that Chad had to stay until about Midnight cleaning the entire load of dishes that he let pile up on me, and the next day, he even helped the one person he scheduled for morning dishes to clean up Breakfast, since he scheduled himself to work the morning shift.

I can and will work from home. My boss' boss called the next morning and said come in or they'll \"accept my resignation\". They gave me a week to \"figure it out\". There is no need to be in the office for my role except to justify middle management's existence and our newly renovated building. I sent an email Monday night (6/20, before my week was up) to my boss and her boss saying I am not coming in 2 days a week per \"policy\". I was professional, but honest and brutal. Literally started the email saying I don't believe the feelings of my return were reciprocated. Noted how my role was completely ignored during my 3 month maternity leave, over 800 emails, 800 items in my queue, my temp replacement quit, management not debriefing me upon my return, etc. I mentioned how many branches and vendors were relieved I was back, and thought it was crazy they'd consider losing a valuable team member.

I drove the lot, picked up an empty trailer, took it to the 2 trailer wash bay building, hooked it up and ran the cycle, then parked the washed trailer in the loading staged area. I was hired as a temp to replace the previous 1st shift guy who injured his knee, when I was hired him and a guy who kinda knew the job taught me how to do it, but there was the only one official 1st shift person who knew the job, the other guy just could kinda fumble his way through it.

It wasnt that bad because 2nd shift didn't have as many trailers, so a 10 hour day and I'd usually be done.  Eventually they hired a new guy, very very big fellow and this... didn't seem like a fit for him. About 3 months in the loaders come over cuz there's no clean trailers staged, they found him passed out on top of a trailer.

One of the companies we delivered to tripled their order and the job worked me to the absolute bone with 90-110 hour weeks during hot summer months. Multiple complaints did nothing but tell me to \"do as I'm told.\" When I was hired I was *told* 7am to 3pm was my shift and my job was to do all the trailers for my shift plus 2 for second shift.  Since complaints fell on deaf ears, I decided to *do as I was told* clocked out at 3pm after finishing first shift trailers plus two. Shut my phone off and had a good time at the fair that night. Next day I'm taken into the office, yelled at for 45 minutes and told they only got 4 trailers done after I left (an amount I could do in 1 hour.)\n",

I can and will work from home. My boss' boss called the next morning and said come in or they'll \"accept my resignation\". They gave me a week to \"figure it out\". There is no need to be in the office for my role except to justify middle management's existence and our newly renovated building. I sent an email Monday night (6/20, before my week was up) to my boss and her boss saying I am not coming in 2 days a week per \"policy\". I was professional, but honest and brutal. Literally started the email saying I don't believe the feelings of my return were reciprocated. Noted how my role was completely ignored during my 3 month maternity leave, over 800 emails, 800 items in my queue, my temp replacement quit, management not debriefing me upon my return, etc. I mentioned how many branches and vendors were relieved I was back, and thought it was crazy they'd consider losing a valuable team member. Going into the office is completely unnecessary for my position and I won't do it. I am not willing, comfortable, or able to do it. \n",

She ended up calling me Tuesday (6/21) and said that her boss emailed her, with my boss' boss cc'ed, and is forcing her to come in now as well. They literally just finished setting her up at home permanently on Friday, and now they're saying nevermind. They want \"consistency\". She was so upset. I never intended for this to happen. She didn't blame me at all though, decided to fight back as well. I had no clue what they're trying to do. There have been a few other exceptions of people not being forced in. Again, we were told it was up to each department originally, but who knows at this point. Maybe they're trying to force out any exceptions so if they fire me I can't claim I'm being singled out and sue or something? Not sure. \n",

Not sure if it was before or after I originally told my boss no, but I sent my first email after hours so I bet it was before. Also they never use Indeed for open positions. That shit costs money.

Not including my commute of 1 hour each direction in Los Angeles traffic.  I knew I was working myself into an early grave.\n",
            "\n",
            "One of the things I always thought was weird about how D managed his subordinates was that he required everyone to provide him with their PC login and password.  Keep in mind this was the early 2000's and our IT was barely able to build a corporate network so this was our best way to monitor what people did on their PC's (or so I was told).\n",
            "\n",
            "It turns out, after hours, D would log on to their PC's and would not just go through their company emails (it was against company policy to use Outlook for any non-company related communication.  And this was audited by D weekly).  He would also look through people's browsing history.  He would set everyone's browsers to automatically save any passwords entered, so he'd read their browser emails (Yahoo, Gmail, etc.).  His justification was that he was looking for any evidence of corporate espionage or violations of proprietary information.\n",
            "\n",
            "One of the most irritating was that he required everyone to save their company Outlook .PST files (where emails are stored) to his network drive.  This allowed him to monitor people's company emails from his own computer.\n",
            "\n",
            "So when our team got so big, we had to hire our own accounting team. Because they fell under D's jurisdiction, he had access to their PST files as well (but our accounting team didn't know this).  This allowed him to monitor a lot of financial communication between our parent company, and also predict where budgetary changes were being made.\n",
            "\n",
            "D would use this to maximize how he strategized his next project initiatives.  He clandestinely knew where the money was going to be before anyone else so he had time to come up with plans on how to get a bigger chunk of that cash.  On the outside, his ability to do this seemed almost preternatural.  But all he was doing was just reading confidential emails without anyone knowing.  All accounting information was kept confidential just within the finance team, so they didn't know D was readily accessing this information.  Like I said, our IT team was barely conscious.\n",
            "\n",
            "D decided he wanted to take a 2 week vacation and left me in charge of monitoring duties.  He showed me where the PST files were.  Internally, I was utterly aghast at how much he was looking at our personal communications.  But, I was young, naïve, and making a salary that most 20-somethings could only dream of so I thought this was normal corporate operations.\n",
            "\n",
            "During D's vacation, one of our reps dropped a cigarette down a plastic drain pipe outside the office.  Turns out he'd been doing that for weeks and the back up of cigarette butts eventually caught fire and it set off the smoke alarm in the building.  We were forced to evacuate and close up shop for the day.  Because I could work remotely, I copied all the PST's to my laptop and headed home.  That's when I discovered something that will haunt me for the rest of my life.\n",
            "\n",
            "In my haste to copy the PST files, I inadvertently copied D's to my computer as well.  Out of morbid curiosity, I figured what the hell, why not?  So I started looking through his emails.  At first, I found emails to another director, where he was disclosing how he was able to 'go where the money is.'  Turns out, another director in another branch was also doing the same thing and they were joking about how they were able to make so much money and set up the manager they left behind to fail.  They talked about how they would share this financial information with advertisers, other publishing firms, etc. to put themselves in strategically advantageous positions for prime accounts.  In a nutshell, what they were doing was sharing corporate information without tacit approval from the legal team.  I saw junior associates get taken to court over this.\n",
            "\n",
            "I also saw emails from several female colleagues who were mysteriously \"removed\" from the company.  Turns out, D had 9 sexual harassment claims against him from these female colleagues.  But because he was so profitable to the company, the CEO turned a blind eye, settled them out of court and then moved D to a different team to avoid any negative perceptions.  Many of these emails between D and these female colleagues was very explicit, and it was very clear his advances were unwanted.  Lots of dick pics, lots of pics of D and his wife engaged in sexual activities hoping the female colleague would want to join in, etc.\n",
            "\n",
            "D also had a folder called \"New Accounts\".  By this point, my image of D was shattered.  The guy I thought was a great mentor was just a sleazebag.  So I looked into that folder, and found a massive collection of some of the most explicit child porn.  My mind will be forever haunted by the filth that I found there.  Even just thinking about it now makes me want to cry for the lost innocence of those poor children.  So I wanted to sink this guy.\n",
            "\n",
            "My thought process was this:  If I straight up reported the CP, it would be obvious where the reporting came from since I was the only one who had access to his PST file.  I didn't want to have a vindictive angry Marine breathing down my neck.  So instead, I reported the accounting irregularities through our anonymous company hotline.  This would trigger an immediate investigation which includes a thorough audit of a person's computer. Even though D had his laptop with him on his vacation, his desktop computer was still very much online at the office.\n",
            "\n",
            "Accounting and legal took the investigation insanely seriously.  Things moved so fast that I got a call from D the next day with a request.  \"I need you to write up two notes.  One note says 'This is my two week notice.' and the second note says 'I tender my resignation effective immediately.' If the CEO asks about me, hand him which ever note you think is best.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "He wanted to resign and collect a severance before the investigation concluded, knowing that the company would have to call the police when they found his CP stash.  If he resigned before the investigation finished, chances are the company would just sweep it under the rug since the \"problem is now gone.\"  I never handed the note to the CEO.  And the police were called.  D was arrested. His wife was also arrested.  His daughter, which turns out, was one of the kids in the stash, was taken in by another family member who completely cut themselves off from D.\n",
            "\n",
            "An added bonus to this was that the subsequent accounting investigation led to a discovery.  Turns out the CEO filed bankruptcy for one of the magazines to secure additional $15 million in funding.  But instead of applying that money to the failing magazine, he pocketed $12 million of it and spent it on lavish homes in other countries.  This led to the CEO also being arrested as well.\n",
            "\n",
            "I left the company shortly after, realizing that the entire place was a toxic shithole of backstabbing and the kind of behavior that went on was actually the norm at this place.\n",
            "\n",
            "Last I heard, D was still in jail, the CEO was penniless, and the entire company was sold off to another parent company because it had gotten so toxic to be associated with it.\n",
            "\n",
            "TLDR: Boss did some shady accounting stuff and I discovered he had CP on his computer. Accounting stuff was reported and police got involved to arrest my boss.  Further accounting anomalies led to discovering CEO was also doing shady stuff with money and he was arrested as well.\n",

            "Addendum:  Hey all, I've been reading some of the comments and thought I would add some additional insight and thoughts behind my post.\n",
            "\n",
            "1. Yes this story is factual.  While the identities of the company and those involved will remain private, for those who have worked in high pressure sales environments will know that people like D are not a rarity.  It's the nature of the type of people that get hired for those kinds of roles.  If you've ever seen the Wolf of Wall St, you'll know the kind of people that were hired at this publishing firm.\n",
            "2. Yes I was making that much in my 20's.  I had been in magazine publishing since my mid teens.  In the 90s I started my own print publication in the whole import automotive racing scene.  It started small, but did gain some notoriety in street racing circles and help caught the attention of some very worthy advertisers.  Being bilingual in Japanese and English, this allowed me to expand my magazine's advertising reach overseas to Japan where the street racing scene was in full swing.  I learned very early on how to do advertising, marketing, sales, and publishing.  However, once that scene started dying down the magazine lost its appeal so I took a lot of my advertising accounts with me to the publishing firm where the above story took place.  Many advertisers are loyal to the sales rep and not the client.\n",
            "3. The event of the story took place around 2008.  While I had a team of 200 sales reps under me, most of their PST files were relatively small since most of their work was via phone sales.  This company was incredibly old fashioned with tech.  Like I said, I was the graphic designer.  I knew how to use Photoshop, InDesign, etc. from my old magazine but I would never actually consider myself to be a professional graphic designer by trade as it was all self taught and very limited.  I just knew how to make things \"camera ready\" (this means high enough resolution for print...300 dpi).  Because I did a lot of graphic design work, I was given a pretty high end laptop for the period.  The hard drive alone was 640GB (it was two 320GB drives in RAID0 array).\n",
            "4. Evacuation of the office.  Perhaps this was strongly assumed to be an immediate emergency evacuation.  We sent everyone home while management assessed what the cause was with the fire department.  That is what I meant by closing up shop.  So it did give me ample time to copy over the PSTs knowing that I'd be working from home later that afternoon.\n",
            "5. To whose who say they would happily work those hours for that kind of pay.  I used to think the same thing, which is why I took the job.  My base pay was $60K plus commission.  And I made a lot of commission and I never missed a sales goal.  I also made commission of my teams.  Those 200 people were divided up into various sub-teams for each magazine we published.  I earned commissions of their total sales as well on top of a monthly sales commission bonus for goals reached.  Keep in mind this was just before the housing crash in 2008.  People were spending money like it would never end.  And our company raked it in.  But here's the rub...I was so perpetually stressed.  My girlfriend at the time, she was a sales rep on a different team, would cry in the car on our way in to work every day.  I worked 6 days a week.  I would be so stressed that my Saturday nights were spent in isolation on my computer playing video games.  I wouldn't sleep until the sun came up on Sunday, then I would sleep all through Sunday until Monday morning.  I was subsisting on 4 to 5 hours of sleep per day during the week.  It took an incredible toll on my body.  Many of my reps were coke addicts and we turned a blind eye to it because it helped them dial faster and sell more.  Some of the managers would staff sales reps from temp agencies asking for people specifically who came out of rehab, knowing they'd relapse at this place where we'd either fire them for performance issues and not pay the staffing agency their hiring fees or they'd be so coked out they'd make a killing in sales.\n",
            "6. To my shame, I never reported the CP.  I had this image of corporate lawyers coming after me and fighting this never ending legal battle of trying to maintain my innocence.  I was young, naive, and didn't know what options I had.  That is why I went with the accounting route through the anonymous company hotline.  I knew they would do a scan of D's computer and audit his emails which is why I moved his CP folder into a more prominent place for it to be found.  Like many corporations, they are more concerned with maintaining a public image and this is something they wouldn't want getting out if it was reported to law enforcement agencies by an employee.  I knew once they found that folder, they would be compelled to contact authorities anyway, so it removed the onus from me and removed me from the equation.  Plus, after learning about D's darker side, I didn't want him or someone sent by him coming after me for ruining his cushy job.  I went with the route I felt would involve me the least and protect my own self the most.  I wish I could have reported it to the authorities.  Now that I'm much older, looking back, I don't know what things I would have done differently.  But now that I'm married and I have a stepson, I think about if I found his photo in there, I can definitely imagine me waiting for him to return so I could exact revenge personally.  But that is a bunch of \"what if's\" and life tends to go very differently.\n",
            "7. Our company IT.  My office was a satellite office in downtown Los Angeles 45 miles away from our main HQ where the IT team was.  It was set up specifically for my team of 200.  To give you an idea how inept our IT team was, our IT project manager was tasked with hiring a consultant who would scope out and build us a custom sales/phone software that would link with our database of advertising accounts and other businesses in our database.  We had one of the largest databases of businesses in this industry where competitors would offer us very large sums of money just for a portion of this database.  Our IT team spent close to $1.6 million on this consultant, and in the end what we were told was a custom program was actually just a turn-key software...for inbound call centers.  We were an outbound sales team.  What this means is that we were given a program that wasn't custom built for us, had problems using our database, and was designed for call centers that received phone calls (eg - cell phone or cable company call centers).  We were an outbound center.  We weren't just a call center as many of our reps also traveled nationally to visit advertisers, so an inbound software was absolutely junk to us.  Because of our IT's ineptitude, I had to learn a lot of IT basics myself.   As far as browsers, most of our staff was using Firefox since it used to be fairly lightweight and quick.\n",
            "8. Like many of the stories in this thread, I understand the skepticism.  Some of the stories sound so over the top and sound like a fabrication.  One thing I've learned from being able to experience quite a lot in life from early on is that there really are shitty people out there like D.  The reason for the throw away account is because my main reddit account is used for work in my current industry and I, unfortunately, deal with the public in my job and I don't want this associated with my actual identity.\n",
            "9. So why post this at all?  I don't care about internet points or accolades, but I do appreciate the comments of support.  In a way it's been a bit cathartic for me to share this publicly.  I've told the story to coworkers before, and I've felt I never really had any closure with it.  This doesn't give me any closure either, but being able to share it on a forum designed for stories like this does help with that burden just a bit.  I hope D's daughter grows up to be as normal as can be expected from a situation like that.  I still keep in contact with a few of my old sales reps.  While I now live quite far away from Los Angeles, I do like to hear back from them to see they're doing ok in life.\n",

            "\n",
            "After I posted this story, I reached out to a few of my former colleagues who I worked with during this time just to see if there were any additional bits of information I might be able to learn.  Even with the few friends and colleagues I do keep in contact with, many of them left before this story happened and many were moved to other teams before the following hammer dropped.\n",
            "\n",
            "One thing I found out tonight from a former colleague was what the aftermath was.  After the CEO was removed, the parent corporation was deciding what to do with my branch.  Because the embezzled money came from one of the magazines my team was on, during the legal hearings the entire office was shuttered.  And it was done in a really shitty way.\n",
            "\n",
            "Every employee at that branch received a FedEx letter on a Saturday stating their employment with the company was terminated.  Again...on a Saturday.  This was done to avoid having to do it face to face while everyone was at the office.  Because this was a surprise, many of them immediately drove down to the office to retrieve their personal belongings only to find hired security guards who were instructed to not let anyone in.  The now-ex-employees were understandably upset.  Part of the reason was because of the amount of embezzled money, the legal teams needed to make sure employees weren't removing any potential evidence.  But what this meant was that they weren't able to retrieve their personal belongings, and some even had their cell phones, valuables, and other items they wanted to retrieve inside the office.  Apparently the office was locked for nearly a year before the staff was able to get court-assisted permission just to retrieve their personal items.  \n",
            "\n",
            "Since then, the building we worked in has been leveled and is now an area being gentrified and has totally turned into a modern, hipster apartment complex.

            "So I'm brand new to WSB but bear with me. Once upon a time, when I was very down on my luck, I walked into a temp agency and asked for any job they could give me. What they had was a factory assembly worker on the line at Blackberry in my hometown of Waterloo, Canada (yep...Canadian alert!). It was a 12hr job with day/night swapping shifts. It was a repetative, monotonous job putting screws into things and doing it all in style in a zero static white suit and blue boots. It was most definitely NOT what I had envisioned for myself for the rest of my life. However, that job would turn out to be one of the most rewarding short-term jobs I've ever had because I sat next to some truly wonderful people on the assembly line.\n",
            "\n",
            "With nothing to do for 12hrs but shoot the sh\\*t, I soon discovered that I was sitting next to doctors from Iran, lawyers from Indonesia, CEOs from Pakistan. Each of them had come to this job out of desperation just like me. Each of them were deemed \"overqualified\" by most other jobs just like me. Each of them had worked hard, invested in company shares (BB had an amazing employee share program) and had made more money there than they could have dreamed. BB had given them the promise of a real future in Canada and you could see the passion they had for this company in their faces. Also, BB once a year rented out the Air Canada Centre (or Rogers or whatever the hell its called now...) and rented a rock band for their employees! Like...ALL of their employees...not just management. I saw ACDC, Steven Tyler, Van Halen and the Tragically Hip. All thanks to BB. They wanted to spread the love.\n",
            "\n",
            "So I got over myself and how I wasn't where I wanted to be, and I used this job to give myself a crash-course on global politics from the amazing people I worked with. I learned about the so-called \"scary\" parts of the world and how beautiful they actually were. When the time came to leave that job and move on to other things, I left with a profound appreciation for hard-working immigrants and just how much dedication it takes to sit down at a factory bench with a $200k salary potential education, and screw things together for $14/hr. I'll never forget those people. And I'll never forget that company. Blackberry gave life, employment, education grants, city improvements and other amazing opportunities to my hometown of Waterloo. When the time came that Apple overtook them and Blackberry faltered, my hometown and the rest of Canada turned its back on them, and that disgusted me.\n",

I can't reply anymore due to the locked thread, but thanks to everyone that has messaged me with the awesome advice,stories, and positive affirmation. Some of you brought a tear to my eye with some things that were said. I'm getting a bit teary eyed now to be honest. I was very hesitant to put my story here, but I knew good people would show up. Thanks so much to all of you guys, even the ones being mean. You guys really made my day today. I don't deserve this. I hope others can find some kind of hope and positivity through this. Thanks everyone!\n",

I didn’t think anything of it as we do have a very personal relationship outside of work as well. As soon as I arrived to her place the tension in the air was thick. She explained that she wanted to discuss a serious matter with me but that she didn’t know how to go about it. I told her to just rip the band-aid off and tell me. She told me that she had found two recordings of a woman she believed to be me on a pornographic website. I told her that wouldn’t be possible but she was adamant that I was the woman in the recording. And she was right. I’ve never recorded myself naked or having sex with my husband but there I was in two recordings of 7 minutes and 4 minutes both of them recorded in our old bedroom. As I rewatched every second of it, it starts to dawn on me that this was my husbands doing. But I pushed that deep down because there must be a reasonable explanation for this. \n",

Then a few days later I spoke to some lawyers my sister had contacted as they had experience with non-consensual material being posted online. They have been handling things with the police as I did press charges and they are dealing with the websites. I also have started the process of divorce. I went to the clinic and got tested and luckily he didn’t give me anything so far but I have another test scheduled just to make sure. I have spoken to his mother and she apologized to me even though it’s not her fault. She told me that she understood why I want him punished. She asked that I let it stay in the hands of the law rather then I hurt him or have him hurt. He’s in hiding but he still calls and texts me from random numbers.

At the end of my second year studying Chemistry, I got a job as a quality controller in food factory. Now the one thing I really learned from that job was the foods to avoid, did you know one of the ingredients in canned Tomato Soup is concentrated hydrochloric acid? Anyhow, I was significantly more qualified in Chemistry than the quality supervisor and after I pointed out some problems in the way they were carrying out some of the tests in the lab, I was put into the cannery where I was told to check the seams on the cans after they were lidded, the vacuum in cans after they were lidded and also that the check weigher was working correctly.\n",

            "One day I was watching the production and canning of Chicken Soup and noticed the line was running just a little light, not below but just on the lower compliance level, so it adjusted the machine to add just a little more soup to the cans. This brought it up to almost the exact weight expected per can. Things ran really smoothly from that point onwards until we got to the end of the run. There was a flurry of activity in the cannery supervisors office and much pointing at paperwork. It seems the cannery had produced around 100 cans less than was expected from the run. Cue the investigation. Turns out that by stopping the line running light and adhering to the can labelling of the weight inside the can I had cost them 100 cans of soup. I was told under no circumstances should I make any adjustments to any production line and I must find a supervisor. Fine, I was only there as a temp after all.\n",

Cue pressing the big red button stopping the canning line. Canneries are noisy places, there are conveyors running Ann the time, cans clattering against each other and then into the retort baskets they are cooked in at the end. All of this stopped and I had the entire room standing wondering what to do. I asked on of the line staff to go and find a supervisor to make the adjustments and I waited. We waited for almost an hour to find someone by which time the soup that needed to be canned had got cold and couldn't be pumped through the canning machines and had to be dumped. \n",

My response was quite blunt I'm afraid. \"Clearly, your margins are dependant on being as close to a can of soup being underweight as possible. I understand that and sought only to protect you from possible litigation under consumer legislation. I was told I was not to do that and find a supervisor to make any changes. In the absence of this chap for over an hour I was faced with two options, either halt production or allow underweight cans to leave the cannery. My career options are not guided by my temporary summer holiday job, and I aspire to something more fulfilling. As I will be returning to University in a few week, I'm going to get changed and you can sort out someone else to check your cannery production. Bye\"\n",

I managed the purchasing for 12 facilities in the US and Europe but if it needs his signature I've got to personally bring it to him and stand there while he reviews it or he's refusing to sign. It was somewhere between humiliating and infuriating and I increasingly wished he'd fall down a staircase.\n",

            "After months of this finally my chance for malicious compliance arrived. Shockingly Bill hasn't managed to turn his pet project around and what do you know, just needs a quarter million to get him through the year. I sign off, add the money to the purchase order which now totals a cool $650k, and shoot off an email to both him and my boss to remind them that this won't be shown to the VP. Then I print everything out, including the direct order not to show it to the VP and march over to the CEO's office for him to sign. After all, it was now over the $500k required limit and Bill never asked for *him* not to see it.\n",

I was there for another year and thankfully Bill never made an appearance at my office ever again.\n",

J told me that he didn't call the oncall pager because this was way too serious of a problem to trust the backup sysadmin.  He wanted me working on this, and that if I can't be relied upon to do my job when I was needed, he'd find someone else who could, and hung up the phone.   I went back to sleep. \n",

Temp files deleted, email services restarted, problem kicked over to our backup software SME to figure out what happened.  Total downtime after B got the call was about 15 minutes.  \n",

My wife told me that M called her, and that I need to call her back as soon as possible.  Come to find out, when S had went off, he was going to M's office to explain the situation and keep him from shitcanning me.  M heard from S, and freaked the hell out.  When I saw her running across the street, she was trying to catch me in the parking lot before I left to tell me to come back in.  When M couldn't find my car, she went back into the office and called the house, intending to leave me a voicemail, but got my wife instead.

Over lunch, my wife and I talked about how we would handle this, and (largely for financial reasons) we decided to talk to them to see if we could work this out. We got back home to 3 more voicemails from M and S. About 30 seconds after we walked in the door, the phone rang again. This time it was J, obviously on speakerphone.

Food that is not otherwise preserved should stay out of the temperature danger zone (either warmer or colder). If your food *must* be in the temperature danger zone, it should be there for less than 2 hours total (including the time to warm up or cool down your food).\n",

It also means you should keep perishable foods below 40ºf, though some common microorganisms can still survive this.

The actual temperature where harmful bacteria fail to grow is closer to 126.1ºf, but this temperature is dangerously close to the temperatures where bacteria grow most rapidly. Without a highly calibrated and consistent heating device, keeping your food at that low a temperature is dangerous.
